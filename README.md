Explosion sprite must not be used for any other means of earning money because its has a copyright. I had used that only for example purpose, taken from examples from phaser.io & not for earning money. Other sprites art free use including sounds. Use node js to fire up the server at localhost only otherwise it would affect the overall game performance at online servers which eventually reduces FPS.
